# domain-adaptation-nn
"[Unsupervised Domain Adaptation by Backpropagation](http://sites.skoltech.ru/compvision/projects/grl/files/paper.pdf)" introduces a simple and effective method for accomplishing domain adaptation with SGD with a gradient reversal layer. This project recreates the MNIST experiment from the paper, using a synthetic dataset.

To generate the synthetic dataset, we blend the MNIST digits with random color patches from the [BSDS500](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/resources.html#bsds500) dataset.

This project was created as a part of my Technical Seminar in the 6th semester of my bachelor's degree.
